                Currenty, I'm focusing on front-end development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript , and I'm excited to dive deeper into back-end technologies as I progress in my studies,As a student , I Love working on hands-on projects, and I enjoy experimenting with different technologies to create interactive and responsive websites.
                
                Through my time at SITRC, I’ve been developing my problem-solving skills and have been part of various group projects, where I’ve learned the importance of collaboration and continuous learning. I’m always exploring new trends in tech and participating in coding challenges to improve my skills.
